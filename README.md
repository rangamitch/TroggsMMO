# TroggsMMO

## What is it?
TroggsMMO is a MMO RPG core for [SpigotMC](https://spigotmc.org) which is made by [Troggs (mitchtheranga)](https://github.com/mitchtheranga) and [these contributors](#Contributors)

## How does it work?
Well, if you are really looking for the way it works (if you are reading this, you probably already know), contact me on discord `Mitch#3456`.

## Jar not working?
If your jar is not working, It is probably because your token, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is not connected, [Redis](https://redis.io) is not connected, or something else is broken.
